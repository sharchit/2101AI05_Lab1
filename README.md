Signup on github.com and make a new repo 
ROLL_Lab1 (ROLL in Caps) and write two sample C codes (make a calculator prog and commit every operation & make a prog that implements . Insertion Sort 路 2. Selection Sort 路 3. Bubble Sort 路 4. Merge Sort 路 5. Quick Sort., commit at every sort),  and commit at regular intervals. 
I should at least see 10 commits per student.
